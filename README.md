💫 About Me:
I am currently working on
DevOps projects while learning AWS CI/CD. I’m gaining hands-on experience with tools like Docker, Kubernetes, Jenkins, GitHub Actions, Terraform, Ansible, Linux, Bash scripting, and monitoring tools such as Prometheus and Grafana.

I’m looking to collaborate on
DevOps, Cloud, and Automation projects where we can build scalable infrastructure, CI/CD pipelines, and cloud-native applications together.

I’m looking for help with
Advanced AWS architecture, running Kubernetes in production, Infrastructure as Code best practices, and improving automation and deployment strategies.

Ask me about
Linux systems, AWS cloud concepts, DevOps tools, and how we can leverage these technologies to build efficient solutions, plus how to get started in cloud and automation.

Fun fact
I love figuring out how complex systems work behind the scenes — once I start exploring, I don’t stop until everything makes sense.
